# Personnal website

## [nair0lf32.github.io](https://nair0lf32.github.io)

My personnal website. (wanted to try github pages).

Made with a free bootstrap template for css and a bit of jquerry and vanilla javascript.

Its my cool personal space and I am gonna add more and more pages and links
of my other projects to it.
