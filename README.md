# Personnal website

## [nair0lf32.github.io](https://nair0lf32.github.io)

My personnal website. (wanted to try github pages)

Made with a free bootstrap template for css and a bit of jquery plus vanilla javascript (I wanted it simple, good-looking and quick to make).

Its my cool personal space and I am gonna add more and more pages and links to it.

**Midly-important Note:** 

In an attempt to get familiar with progressive web app (PWA) development, I tried it on this website (and it worked)
But I don't think I need it anymore (it is just a simple page and I don't need that content cached)

I want to keep this website very simple and I am already working on improving its performance (mostly removing render-blocking junks)

**Therefore It is highly advised to remove any previous installation (if any) of this website and clear your browser cache**, to get the updated online version.
